# Klein Mongo

Module to allow simple instantiation of MongoDB from configuration

Host can be provided as a URI or an SRV record (see config.yml for an example)

It is not possible to test this with Pytest, but functionality can be verified by running `main.py` with the `config.yml` included in the parent directory
